 * The EE-API Library has 2 main functions. The first function is controlling and drawing on the VGA screen. This is done <br>
 * with the class Vgascreen which uses the STM32_UB_VGA library to draw the single pixels on the screen and keep the screen <br>
 * on (VGA needs constant updating). The second function is reading the UART input and sending messages back using UART to the<br>
 * terminal.<br>
 * <br>
 * @subsection vga_sec Vgascreen
 * If a Vgascreen object is created it initializes the STM32_UB_VGA library. After that the different draw methods can be called.<br>
 * The different methods calculates which pixel needs to be set with the given color value and sends this to the STM32_UB_VGA lib.<br>
 * The different fonts and bitmaps are kept in the header file.<br>

 * @subsection uart_sec UART
